      <description>Timelapse Box Build
To start, I had to figure out a way to trigger the camera to take a picture. Fortunately, there is a port on the side of Canon cameras to attach a shutter release cable (image below adapted from Canon 6D manual). These cables are usually attached to a remote that you can use to take a photo, which helps to prevent camera shake. I wanted to be able to use this port to trigger the camera with an Arduino, which isn&#39;t very common, so I had to make my own cable.</description>

      <description>Timelapse Box Code and Operation
I tried to make using this device as simple as possible to operate with the components I had available. Right after turning on the Arduino, the timing intereval can be adjusted by turning the potentiometer. While doing this, the intereval setting is printed out on the LCD in seconds. Once the intereval is set, the button is pressed to start the timelapse. While photos are being taken, a progress bar counts down to when the next photo is about to be taken, with an exclamation mark displayed as the camera is being triggered.</description>
