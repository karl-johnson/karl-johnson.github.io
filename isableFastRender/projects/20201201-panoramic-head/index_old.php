   <t1> motorized panoramic tripod head </t1><br>

  <div id="content-blue-edges"> <p>In this video, I show off a project I've been working on for a while: a homemade motorized panoramic tripod head.</p>

      <p> A few things not mentioned in the video: </p>
      <ul>
          <li> I originally didn't use a belt design for driving the two axes, and instead started with a worm gear system. Though the worm gear system had higher reduction over the current belt-driven design (which allows for better precision in positioning the camera), it was significantly less robust and more bulky than simply using belts. </li>
          <div id="grid">
            <a href="/coming-soon/panograph.jpg">
                <span id="thumbnail">
                    <img src="/coming-soon/panograph.jpg" >
                </span>
            </a>
          </div>
          <li> The camera and lens combination shown in the thumbnail (and near the end of the video) weighs approximately 8 pounds.</li>
          <li> Devices available commercially that support payloads of this weight and have similar features (such as the <a href="http://www.omegabrandess.com/products/Gigapan/GigaPan-EPIC-Pro">GigaPan Epic Pro</a>) usually cost around $900-1000. I didn't keep a close tally, but the cost of this project was probably around $250-300. </li>
          <li> My next major goal with this device is to take a 10 gigapixel panorama using the device in its current state. (EDIT: I have now taken a <a href="/photos/Panoramas/20210223/">12 gigapixel panorama </a> with this device). After that, I plan on developing an Android app to control the device over Bluetooth.</li>
      </ul>
