    <t1> about </t1><br>
    <p> I am an electrical engineering student at UC San Diego who is also interested in photonics, imaging, life sciences, rock climbing, baking, and projects which involve any number of those things. For any questions, concerns, or website issues you can email me at <a href='mailto:k@rljohnson.net'> k@rljohnson.net</a>.<br>

    <p> Another note: due to the nature of my panoramic photography, panoramas on this site may incidentally display images of people without their express permission. If you object to your likeness being shown in one of my panoramas, simply contact me and I'd be more than happy to edit you out.<br>
