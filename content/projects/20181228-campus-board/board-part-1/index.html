   <t1> the board, part 1 </t1><br>

   <p> My first idea was to make an <i>almost</i> full sized board (normal campus boards are around 6' tall). The board alone would be 4' across by 5' tall; to save space, it would fold out from the wall, and for versatility, its angle would be adjustible. I almost finished a whole CAD model in Autodesk Inventor of this idea: </p>

   <p> However, after visiting my brother's dorm, I realized this was far too large to fit in the room. Instead, I created a completely new model, where the board was only 4' by 1.5', with no complicated structure behind it. This smaller board was much more likely to fit <i>somewhere</i> in the apartment, whether mounted over a doorway or bolted to one of the exposed joists. Instead of permanently bolting the campus board rungs to the board, I decided to construct the board much like a normal climbing wall, where each hole is threaded to accept a standard 3/8"-16 climbing bolt. This allows for the types and arrangment of holds to be changed at will. </p>

   <p> The construction of this version is very simple - a 3/4" board with a bunch of holes drilled in it. To make it, (surprise!) I trimmed a board of plywood I found in my garage, then I drilled a bunch of holes in it. To prevent the back of the holes from splintering out, I made sure to drill with a scrap piece of wood behind the plywood. </p>

   <p> I then pressed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBRKYHC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">t-nuts</a> into the back of the board. First, I tapped them partially in with a mallet; since this doesn't pull the long prongs on each t-nut all the way into the wood, I then tightened <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M6YJTQS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">a climbing bolt</a> (with some spacers) on each t-nut to press each one all the way in. </p>

   <p> The board was now ready to be painted. I wanted to prevent the threads from getting gunked up with paint, so (after a few other ideas failed) I stuffed a small piece of paper towel in each hole in the board. It took two coats of black paint for the board to be as dark as I wanted.</p>
