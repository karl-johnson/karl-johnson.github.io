   <t1> Compact Campus Board </t1><br>
   <p> The climbing gym my brother goes to near his college has no campus board.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=campus+board&safe=strict&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ69He4sbfAhWLpYMKHa3IAiUQ_AUIDygC&biw=1600&bih=801"> A campus board</a> is a tool rock climbers use to exersize climbing without legs ("campusing"). All examples I've seen look very simple, so I thought it'd be a good Christmas gift to make one that you could easily swap out holds on and would fit in my brother's apartment. <br> </p>
