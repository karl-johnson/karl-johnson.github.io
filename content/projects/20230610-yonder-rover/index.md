# yonder rover

I spent a lot of time during my undergrad at UCSD working on Yonder Dynamics, an engineering project team focusing on building a Mars Rover for the University Rover Challenge.

From a high level, these rovers are of a medium size (must fit in a 4" cube and weigh less than 110 lbs) and moderate budget (total price <$18k USD). The competition is only slightly modified every year, so the same rovers can be re-used/upgraded by teams year-to-year. There are two main stages to the competition. The first is the Systems Acceptance Review (SAR), a video submission due around early March. The 36 teams with the best SAR qualify for the main event: the URC finals at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in Hanksville, Utah.

This competition site is an extremely unique place to have an engineering competition, located really in the middle of nowhere in Utah [more desc].

As implied by those videos, the actual tasks each rover must do are split into 4 different missions: Extreme Delivery (perform simple tasks on larger objects while traversing rough terrain over long distances), Equipment Servicing (perform precise tasks that require fine control), Science (collect and image samples to determine the presence of life), and Autonomous (navigate autonomously over rough terrain to increasingly more difficult-to-find posts). All challenges except Autonomous are teleoperated by drivers who cannot see the rover and must completely drive from cameras (during Autonomous there are also human operators who monitor over cameras and can also occasionally program the rover).

Though I was on Yonder Dynamics for all 4 years of my undergrad, the competition was not held in-person in 2020 or 2021. As such, my involvement only really ramped up for the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seasons, during both of which I was the head of the team. The high-level story of these two years is us as a team constantly battling the two-year-long gap in engineering development and leadership continuity that was inevitable after years of remote learning and lockdowns (which is likely quite relatable for anyone who was also part of a student organization or engineering team during this time!). Be sure to check out the two pages below to see what happened during these two years:

Finally, in addition to these short summaries, I've also written a page about the development of the spectrometry-focused science module on our 2022-2023 rover. This development process is fascinating not only because I think the engineering of the system is a really fun topic, but also because of the ... extremely fiting outcome that has taught me valuable lessons about project management.
