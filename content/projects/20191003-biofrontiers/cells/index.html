   <p> Lots of the imaging we did in Biofrontiers was of cells. <br> </p>

   <p> The above images show the cytoskeleton (red) and mitochondia (green) of some bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (BPAE) cells. The first image is a <b>large</b> panorama created using the same SIM stitching techniques I've used in <a href="../neurons/">many</a> other <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/765396">projects.</a> The second image shows a zoom-in of a region in the first image, with the top half showing a conventional fluorescence microscope image and the bottom showing our superresolution processing method, MAPSIM. While this particlar sample was bought from <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F36924?SID=srch-srp-F36924">Thermofisher</a>, we grew our own cells too: <br> </p>

      <p>This particular photo is actually from a failed experiment where cells shriveled up and died while taking a timelapse of them - the colorful effect in this image comes from color-coding every frame of the timelapse and merging all the frames into one image.</p>
