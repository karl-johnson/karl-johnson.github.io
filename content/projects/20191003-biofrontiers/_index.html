<t1> UCCS Biofrontiers Gallery </t1><br>
<p> Enjoy some pretty pictures from my time at the UCCS biofrontiers lab! My time at this lab was spent on all sorts of projects, but I spent a lot of time imaging things with structured illumination microscopy (SIM), making micro-needles for cell capture and microinjection, and playing around with optics. I also wrote <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/765396">this paper</a> about creating large seamless panoramas of SIM images, which you can view online in the 'Full Slide Imaging' section below!<br> </p>
