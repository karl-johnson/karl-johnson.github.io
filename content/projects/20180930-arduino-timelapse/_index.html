   <t1> Hot-Shoe Mountable Timelapse Box </t1><br>
   <p> I've taken a few timelapses manually, by setting a timer on my phone and taking a photo every 30 seconds, 5 minutes, or whatever intereval I choose. This is tedious, and I thought that using my Arduino to do this for me would be much easier and more fun.</p><br>
